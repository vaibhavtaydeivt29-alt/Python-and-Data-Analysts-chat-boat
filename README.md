AI Chatbot Using Python (Rule-Based)
Project Description

This project is a console-based AI Chatbot developed using Python, designed to simulate basic human–computer interaction through predefined rules and keyword matching. The chatbot continuously interacts with users, understands simple text inputs, and provides relevant responses related to Python programming and Data Science.

The chatbot uses conditional logic and string processing to identify user intent and respond appropriately. It also includes feedback handling and a graceful exit mechanism, making the interaction smooth and user-friendly.
